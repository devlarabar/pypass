# PyPass

Your friendly neighborhood password generator.

## About

PyPass is a simple password generator that runs in your terminal.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/devlarabar/pypass.git```

Run `main.py` and follow the prompts.

## The Basics

If you're not into the extra fluff, change the last line from

```pypass.begin_program()```

to

```pypass.generate_password(length, symbols, mixed_case, banned)```

And, of course, remember to actually pass in your arguments. This will simply print out your generated password immediately, without prompting you to input your arguments individually in the terminal.

But, that's no fun, right? I recommend running the program as-is for maximum enjoyment and user-friendliness.

Enjoy!
